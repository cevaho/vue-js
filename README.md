## The project

_Description :_
[What has to be done](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Johnson-3.9/tree/master/Projets/Mets-Tes-Hauts)

### Project provided

We thought we would have followed this wireframe
[first layout idea on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MUSukZoNaNOy8YAq28198SkW/OpenWeatherMap?node-id=0%3A1)  
we could, but we had new ideas developping and extracting datas, at the end the two results are completely different.

Instead of a single projet split by tasks, that only one person does,
we prefered doing everything twice, both of us testing how to use vue and treating data from json object.
We also had two different ways to treat datas and showing them. [In my case](https://cevaho.github.io/vue-js/dist/), I have shown 4 days forecasted, each hour is shown directly, in the [Jean's case](https://jean-oikonomou.github.io/FLOYDMYWEATHER/dist/), the user clicks on the hour he wants to display before showing it.
Developping something else, both of us discovered something that helped the other to go on, something that unblocks.
Especially to treate datas, or debug the Vue building (https instead of http for json url), as it was not possible to build the vue on the computer I had (even if I installed npm, multiples packages, numerous time, installing Vue was hard).
